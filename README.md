# Lukseh.org Launcher
This is a simple launcher for the Lukseh.org servers and some functions like skin changer and more.
If you have any suggestions or bugs, please report them to me on discord lukseh74 or on the github issues page.
Any questions regarding the website or use of the launcher for your own servers can be asked on the [discord server](https://lukseh.org/dc).
# Installation
I opted to use yarn for the package manager, so you will need to install it first.
The app is made with tauri v2, so i recommend using the latest version of nodejs, yarn and rust.
As i don't know Rust i used JavaScript for the backend, so you will need to install nodejs and yarn.
More install info will be added later as right now project is in development.
Info on how to use the launcher can be found in the [wiki](https://wiki.lukseh.org/launcher).
